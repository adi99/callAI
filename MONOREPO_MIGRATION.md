# Monorepo Migration Complete ✅

Your CallAI repository has been successfully converted to a monorepo structure!

## What Changed

### 🏗️ Directory Structure
```
Before:
callai/
├── src/              # Frontend files
├── backend/          # Backend files
├── package.json      # Frontend dependencies
└── ...

After:
callai/
├── apps/
│   ├── frontend/     # All frontend files moved here
│   │   ├── src/
│   │   ├── package.json
│   │   └── ...
│   └── backend/      # All backend files moved here
│       ├── src/
│       ├── package.json
│       └── ...
├── package.json      # Root workspace configuration
└── README.md         # Updated with monorepo instructions
```

### 📦 Package Configuration

1. **Root package.json**: Now manages workspaces and provides unified scripts
2. **Frontend package.json**: Scoped as `@callai/frontend` with all React dependencies
3. **Backend package.json**: Scoped as `@callai/backend` with all Node.js dependencies

### 🔧 Available Scripts

From the root directory, you can now run:

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev

# Start individual services
npm run dev:frontend    # Start React app on :5173
npm run dev:backend     # Start Node.js API on :3001

# Build applications
npm run build           # Build both
npm run build:frontend  # Build React app only
npm run build:backend   # Build Node.js API only

# Other utilities
npm run lint           # Lint both apps
npm run clean          # Clean build directories
npm run start          # Start production backend
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Copy your existing `.env` file to `apps/backend/.env`
   - All environment variables remain the same

3. **Test the Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Start both services
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   - Frontend should be available at: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API should be available at: http://localhost:3001

4. **Update Development Workflow**:
   - Use the root-level scripts for most operations
   - You can still `cd` into individual apps if needed
   - All your existing environment variables and configurations are preserved

## Benefits of This Structure

✅ **Unified Development**: Start both frontend and backend with one command
✅ **Dependency Management**: Shared dependencies are deduplicated
✅ **Build Optimization**: Build both apps with unified commands
✅ **Scalability**: Easy to add new apps/packages in the future
✅ **Team Collaboration**: Clear separation of concerns
✅ **CI/CD Ready**: Simplified deployment pipelines

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Dependencies not found**: Run `npm install` from the root
2. **Scripts not working**: Ensure you're running from the root directory
3. **Environment variables**: Check that `.env` is in `apps/backend/`
4. **Port conflicts**: Frontend uses :5173, backend uses :3001

## What Wasn't Changed

- All your existing code and functionality remains intact
- Environment variables and configuration work the same way
- Database schemas and external integrations are unchanged
- The application behavior is identical to before

Your CallAI application is now ready to use with the new monorepo structure! 🎉
