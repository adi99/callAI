# Voice-Enabled Ecommerce Customer Service Platform

# Overview  
A voice-enabled customer service platform that connects to ecommerce stores (Shopify, WooCommerce, etc.) and provides intelligent, automated phone support for customers. The system uses advanced AI (LLMs), natural text-to-speech (ElevenLabs), and voice communication (Twilio) to handle customer inquiries about products, orders, delivery status, and common issues in real-time. Store owners can connect their existing ecommerce platforms, and the system automatically syncs product catalogs, order data, and store policies to provide contextually accurate responses to customer calls.

The platform solves the problem of 24/7 customer support availability without requiring human agents, reducing operational costs while maintaining high-quality customer service. It's designed for small to medium ecommerce businesses who want to provide professional phone support but lack the resources for dedicated call centers.

# Logical Dependency Chain

## Foundation First (Phase 1)
- Database and ORM setup → API framework → Store integration → Frontend connection flow
- Must establish secure data sync before any voice features
- Dashboard needs to show connected store data to validate integration

## Voice Pipeline (Phase 2)  
- Twilio setup → STT integration → Basic LLM → TTS integration → Call logging
- Each component must work in isolation before chaining together
- Start with simple greetings before complex interactions

## Intelligence Layer (Phase 3)
- Context management → Function calling → Conversation memory → Advanced routing
- Requires Phase 1 data sync to provide meaningful context
- Build on Phase 2 voice pipeline for delivery mechanism

## Scale and Polish (Phases 4-5)
- Multi-platform support → Advanced analytics → Production hardening
- Requires stable foundation from previous phases
- Focus on reliability and user experience improvements

# Risks and Mitigations  

## Technical Challenges
- **Voice latency and quality**: Mitigate with audio optimization, regional servers, and fallback TTS options
- **LLM accuracy and hallucination**: Address with careful prompt engineering, function calling validation, and escalation rules
- **API rate limiting**: Handle with request queuing, caching strategies, and graceful degradation
- **Real-time data consistency**: Solve with webhook reliability, retry mechanisms, and data validation

## MVP Scope Management
- **Feature creep**: Maintain strict Phase 1 scope focusing only on Shopify integration and basic dashboard
- **Over-engineering**: Start with simple, working solutions before optimizing
- **Integration complexity**: Begin with one platform (Shopify) before expanding to others

## Resource Constraints
- **API costs**: Monitor usage carefully, implement caching, and set usage limits
- **Development time**: Prioritize core functionality over polish in early phases
- **Testing complexity**: Focus on automated testing for critical voice pipeline components
